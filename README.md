This repository demonstrates a subtle but common TypeScript error related to type assertions and mixed-type arrays.  The `bug.ts` file shows a function designed to process a number array that unexpectedly throws a type error when given an array containing both numbers and strings.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a solution illustrating how to handle such situations, thereby enhancing type safety without sacrificing flexibility.
